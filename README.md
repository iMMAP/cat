### iMMAP PROducts catalog and VErsion control

**iMPROVE** is an information products catalogue and web platform for managing the publication and versioning of these products, it allows IMOs to upload their products, help both IMOs and direct managers in the process of reviewing and finalizing the products and keep track of all the different versions of the same product using friendly UI and real-time notifications.

This repo is currently built using .NET C#, but for better deployment options it will be ported to .NET CORE.
